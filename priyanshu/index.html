                    Event by<strong> ENVIRO CLUB</strong>
                    <p class="about">Lumpy skin disease is an emerging bovine viral disease, which is endemic in most African countries and some 
                    Middle East ones, and the elevated risk of the spread of disease into the rest of Asia and Europe should be considered. 
                    The recent rapid spread of disease in currently disease‐free countries indicates the importance of understanding the
                    limitations and routes of distribution.
